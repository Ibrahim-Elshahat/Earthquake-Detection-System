# Earthquake Detection System

This repository contains the code for an earthquake detection system using an Arduino and Processing.

## Overview

The system consists of two main components:
- Arduino code for earthquake detection using an accelerometer.
- Processing code for visualizing earthquake data received from Arduino.

## Instructions

1. Connect the Arduino and upload the provided Arduino code.
2. Connect the accelerometer to the specified pins.
3. Upload the Processing code to visualize earthquake data.
4. Run the Processing sketch to monitor real-time earthquake data.

## Inputs and Outputs

### Arduino Code
- **Inputs:**
  - Accelerometer sensor data from pins A0, A1, and A2.
- **Outputs:**
  - LCD display for monitoring.
  - Buzzer and LED for earthquake alerts.
  - Serial communication for data visualization.

### Processing Code
- **Inputs:**
  - Serial data from Arduino containing x, y, and z values.
- **Outputs:**
  - Real-time graph representing changes in x, y, and z axes.
